js-Identicon
============

Identicon generator in javascript using the HTML5 canvas element

Will eventually make into a jQuery plugin for the curious minds and add more complexity

/js/mydenticon.js contains my implementation and calls to the other scripts used.

Why client-side vs having a server process it? 

1. Well, why not? HTML5 + Javascript gives us a lot of leeway to perform such tasks browser-side ^_^.
2. The real reason is because I had a time crunch and discovered a number of langauge restrictions with my current host. Version 0.2 will show both the current client-based solution and the server-based solution (Probably PHP or Ruby since I've never worked in either but want to learn)
