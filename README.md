js-Identicon
============

Identicon generator in javascript using the HTML5 canvas element

Will eventually make into a jQuery plugin for the curious minds and add more complexity

/js/mydenticon.js contains my implementation and calls to the other scripts used.

Why client-side vs having a server process it? 

Well, why not? HTML5 + Javascript gives us a lot of leeway to perform such tasks browser-side instead of serving up the whole page or creating an image on the server to be rendered later.
